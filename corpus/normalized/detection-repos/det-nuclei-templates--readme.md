Templates are the core of the [nuclei scanner](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei) which powers the actual scanning engine.
This repository stores and houses various templates for the scanner provided by our team, as well as contributed by the community.
We hope that you also contribute by sending templates via **pull requests** or [Github issues](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=submit-template.md&title=%5Bnuclei-template%5D+) to grow the list.
